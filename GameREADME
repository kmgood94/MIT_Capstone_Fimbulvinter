DEFECTS:
Keep an eye out for these defects in gameplay.
- Loot drops do not always spawn.
- Information like the current health bar state and the inventory do not carry between scenes. 
- When in the house scenes, attempting to leave on the left side of the screen results in the player getting stuck.

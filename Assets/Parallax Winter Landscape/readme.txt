
Thank you for downloading Winter Parallax Landscape.

Here is an overview of the contents of this package:

------------------------------------------------------
-Assets: This is the root folder for all assets.

-Materials: Contains the snowflakes material which can be used for snow particle effects as demonstrated in the 'parallax_demo' scene.

-Prefabs: Contains a snow flake particle system, snow sparkles particle system and several premade tiling parallax layers.

-Scripts: Contains the BGScroller script which is used in the 'parallax_demo' scene. The script can be added to any Game Object as a component. Then a Scroll Speed value can be assigned to make the Game Object scroll endlessly. See the 'parallax_demo' scene for examples.

-Sprites: Contains three folders with sprite assets. There's a folder with assets created for 4K assets and one for 2048x1536. There's also a folder for vfx sprites.

-Src PSB: contains the Photoshop source files. This will allow you to make edits in case you want to separate more elements or require a different resolution.

-Demo: Two demo scenes. 'parallax_demo' shows an example of an endlessly scrolling background, using the premade parallax layers. 'asset_overview' shows all available assets in the highest resolution.

The demo scene has been made using the 2048x1536 assets and is only there to show a possible implementation for the background and to provide an example of the layer order. It has not been optimized for any specific device, so you are advised to build your own version, based on your specific needs.

To view the examples, simply open each scene and run it.
